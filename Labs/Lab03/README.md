## Task 1 – Handling Local and Remote Commit Conflicts (Pull vs Pull --rebase)

This task demonstrates what happens when your local repository and remote repository both have new commits — and how `git pull` and `git pull --rebase` behave differently.

### Steps

1. Open your repository on **GitHub** and edit the `README.md` file directly in the browser.  
   - Add a new line such as:  
     ```
     This line was added remotely from GitHub.
     ```
   - Commit your change on GitHub (e.g., message: *Remote update to README*).
   - Save a screenshot of your browser showing the change as `remote_edit.png`.

2. On your **local machine**, open the same repository folder.  
   - Edit the same `README.md` file locally, for example:  
     ```
     This line was added locally.
     ```
   - Stage and commit your change:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Local update to README"
     ```
   - Save a screenshot of your terminal as `local_commit.png`.

3. Try to push:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   You’ll see an error message similar to:
   ```
   ! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)
   error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:username/repo.git'
   hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.
   ```
   - Save a screenshot of this error as `push_error.png`.

4. To fix this, pull the latest changes from remote:
   ```bash
   git pull --no-rebase origin main
   ```
   - Git will **merge** your local and remote commits, creating a *merge commit*.
   - Save a screenshot as `merge_commit.png`.

5. Push again:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `push_after_merge.png`.

6. Now repeat the same process, but this time use **rebase instead of merge**:
   - Make another remote edit on GitHub in `README.md`.  
   - Then make another local edit and commit it.  
   - Instead of using `git pull`, run:
     ```bash
     git pull --rebase origin main
     ```
     - Git will **replay your local commits on top** of the pulled commits, keeping history linear.
     - Save a screenshot as `rebase_pull.png`.
   - Push again:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin main
     ```
     - Save a screenshot as `push_after_rebase.png`. 

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
- `remote_edit.png`  
- `local_commit.png`  
- `push_error.png`  
- `merge_commit.png`  
- `push_after_merge.png`  
- `rebase_pull.png`
- `push_after_rebase.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- `git pull --no-rebase` merges remote changes with your local commits, possibly creating a merge commit.
- `git pull --rebase` keeps commit history linear by replaying your local commits on top of the updated remote branch.
- Both are ways to resolve push conflicts when your local repo is behind the remote.

---

## Task 2 – Creating and Resolving Merge Conflicts Manually

This task will help you understand how Git handles file conflicts when two people modify the same line of code differently.

### Steps

1. On **GitHub (remote)**, open your `README.md` file and change an existing line.  
   For example, if it currently says:
   ```
   This line was added remotely from GitHub.
   ```
   Change it to:
   ```
   This line was updated remotely again.
   ```
   - Commit your change with the message: *Remote conflicting change*  
   - Save a screenshot as `remote_conflict_edit.png`.

2. On your **local machine**, edit the **same line** in the same file but make a **different change**:  
   ```
   This line was updated locally at the same time.
   ```
   - Save a screenshot of your edit in VS Code as `local_conflict_edit.png`.

3. Stage and commit your local change:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Local conflicting change"
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `local_conflict_commit.png`.

4. Try to push:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - The push will be **rejected**, since the remote version has conflicting changes.  
   - Save a screenshot of this error as `conflict_push_error.png`.

5. Pull with rebase to bring in remote changes:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```
   - Git will **pause** the rebase and notify you about a conflict.  
   - Save a screenshot of the conflict message as `conflict_message.png`.

6. Open the `README.md` file in your editor — you’ll see conflict markers like this:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   This line was updated locally at the same time.
   =======
   This line was updated remotely again.
   >>>>>>> origin/main
   ```
   - Manually edit the file to keep the correct line (for example, merge both ideas).  
   - Save a screenshot of the resolved file as `resolved_readme.png`.

7. After fixing the file, mark the conflict as resolved and continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git rebase --continue
   ```
   - Save a screenshot of this step as `rebase_continue.png`.

8. Finally, push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `push_after_resolve.png`.

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
- `remote_conflict_edit.png`
- `local_conflict_edit.png`
- `local_conflict_commit.png`
- `conflict_push_error.png`
- `conflict_message.png`
- `resolved_readme.png`
- `rebase_continue.png`
- `push_after_resolve.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- When two people edit the same line, Git will pause and ask for manual conflict resolution.
- Conflict markers appear in the file and you must choose what to keep.
- After resolving, continue the rebase and push to remote.
- This process ensures both sets of changes are handled safely.

## Task 3 – Managing Ignored Files with .gitignore and Removing Tracked Files

In this task, you will learn how to use a `.gitignore` file to exclude files or directories from version control and how to remove them from Git’s tracking while keeping them locally.

### Steps

1. Create a new folder named `textfiles` inside your repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir textfiles
   ```

2. Inside the `textfiles` folder, create three text files:
   ```bash
   echo "File A content" > textfiles/a.txt
   echo "File B content" > textfiles/b.txt
   echo "File C content" > textfiles/c.txt
   ```

3. Add and commit the new directory:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added textfiles directory with three files"
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `push_textfiles.png`.

4. Now, create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your repository:
   ```bash
   echo "textfiles/*" > .gitignore
   ```

5. Add and commit the `.gitignore` file:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Added .gitignore to ignore textfiles directory"
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `gitignore_push.png`.

6. Go to **GitHub** and check your repository — notice that the `textfiles` directory is **still visible** on the remote.
   - Save a screenshot as `repo_still_has_textfiles.png`.

7. To remove already tracked files from Git (but not from your local system), run:
   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached textfiles
   ```

8. Commit and push again:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Removed tracked textfiles directory"
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `rm_cached_push.png`.

9. Check your GitHub repository again — the `textfiles` folder should now be **deleted remotely**.
   - Save a screenshot as `repo_textfiles_removed.png`.

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
- `push_textfiles.png`
- `gitignore_push.png`
- `repo_still_has_textfiles.png`
- `rm_cached_push.png`
- `repo_textfiles_removed.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- `.gitignore` prevents new files from being tracked, but does not remove ones already tracked.
- To untrack files that are already committed, use `git rm --cached`.
- This lets you keep files locally but remove them from the remote repo.

---

## Task 4 – Create Temporary Changes and Use git stash

This task demonstrates how `git stash` allows you to temporarily save uncommitted changes so that you can safely switch branches without losing work.

### Steps

1. Create a `feature-branch`.  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
2. Modify any file (for example, `README.md`) by adding a few test lines.  
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Changes the README.md file"
   ```   
   - Save a screenshot as `modified_readme.png`.
3. Modify any file (for example, `README.md`) by adding a few new lines.
4. Without committing or stashing the changes, try to switch to another branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
   You’ll see an error message similar to:
   ```
   error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
   README.md
   Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `checkout_error.png`.

5. To fix this, **stash your changes**:
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `stash_command.png`.

6. Try switching branches again — it should now work:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `branch_switched.png`.

7. Return to your previous branch (for example, `feature-branch`):
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `back_to_feature.png`.

8. Check your working directory status:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   It should show:
   ```
   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `status_clean.png`.

9. Now restore your stashed changes:
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```
   You’ll see a message indicating that changes were reapplied:
   ```
   On branch feature-branch
   Changes not staged for commit:
     (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
     (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `stash_pop.png`.

10. Confirm that your previous edits are back in the file.

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
- `modified_readme.png`
- `checkout_error.png`
- `stash_command.png`
- `branch_switched.png`
- `back_to_feature.png`
- `status_clean.png`
- `stash_pop.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- `git stash` saves your uncommitted changes, letting you switch branches safely.
- You can restore stashed changes anytime with `git stash pop`.
- This is useful for quickly saving work-in-progress without cluttering commit history.

---

## Task 5 – Checkout a Specific Commit Using git log

1. View commit history:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `log_before_checkout.png`.

2. Copy any previous commit hash (e.g., `a1b2c3d`).  
3. Checkout that commit:
   ```bash
   git checkout <commit-hash>
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `detached_head.png`.

4. To return to your main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `back_to_main.png`.

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
- `log_before_checkout.png`
- `detached_head.png`
- `back_to_main.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- You can revisit past versions by checking out a specific commit hash.
- In detached HEAD state, changes are not attached to any branch.
- Always return to your main branch after inspecting old commits.

---

## Task 6 – Resetting Commits (Soft vs Hard Reset) **(With Verification Steps)**

This task demonstrates the difference between a soft and hard reset in Git. In this version, you will **verify the presence of changes in files and confirm the existence of commits after each reset**.

### Steps

1. **Add a new line in any file and commit it:**
   ```bash
   # Edit any file (e.g., README.md), add a line
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added test line"
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `first_commit.png`.

2. **Add another change and commit again:**
   ```bash
   # Edit the file again, add a different line
   git add .
   git commit -m "Second test commit"
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `second_commit.png`.

3. **View the history before reset:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `log_before_reset.png`.

4. **Check file contents for both changes:**
   - Open the edited file (e.g., README.md) and visually confirm BOTH added lines exist.
   - Save a screenshot as `file_before_reset.png`.


5. **Perform a soft reset (keeps changes in working directory):**
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `soft_reset.png`.

6. **Check commit history after soft reset:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `log_after_soft_reset.png`.

7. **Verify changes in the file:**
   - Open the file again and confirm both edits are still present (nothing lost).
   - Save a screenshot as `file_after_soft_reset.png`.

8. **Check git status:**  
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - You should see your changes are staged (ready to commit again).

9. **Perform commit**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Second Test commit"
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `file_after_hard_reset.png`.

10. **Perform a hard reset (discards changes completely):**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `hard_reset.png`.

11. **Check commit history after hard reset:**
    ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```
    - Save a screenshot as `log_after_hard_reset.png`.

12. **Verify changes in the file:**
    - Open the file and confirm the **second edit is gone** (reverted to previous commit).
    - Save a screenshot as `file_after_hard_reset.png`.

13. **Check git status:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    - Should report "nothing to commit, working tree clean".

---

### 📸 **Screenshot Required:**
- `first_commit.png`
- `second_commit.png`
- `log_before_reset.png`
- `file_before_reset.png`
- `soft_reset.png`
- `log_after_soft_reset.png`
- `file_after_soft_reset.png`
- `file_after_hard_reset.png`
- `hard_reset.png`
- `log_after_hard_reset.png`
- `file_after_hard_reset.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- Soft reset keeps your changes in the file (you can recommit them).
- Hard reset removes the latest commit AND the associated changes from your files.
- Always check both the commit history and your file contents after resetting to understand what was kept and what was discarded.

---

## Task 7 – Amending the Last Commit

1. Make a small change in any file.  
2. Stage it and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix log message"
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `first_amend_commit.png`.

3. Realize you forgot to change another file. Update it now.  
4. Add it and amend the last commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit --amend
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `amend_commit.png`.

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
- `first_amend_commit.png`
- `amend_commit.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- `git commit --amend` lets you modify your last commit, including its message or staged files.
- Useful for quick fixes before pushing to remote.
- Once pushed, amending requires force-push to update remote history.

---

## Task 8 – Reverting a Commit (Safe Undo on Remote Branch)

1. Make a change and commit it:
   ```bash
   echo "temporary text" >> temp.txt
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added temporary text file"
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `commit_temp_file.png`.

2. Now revert that commit safely (do not delete it):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `revert_commit.png`.

3. Push the revert commit:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `revert_push.png`.

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
- `commit_temp_file.png`
- `revert_commit.png`
- `revert_push.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- `git revert <hash>` creates a new commit that undoes changes from a specific commit.
- It does not rewrite history, making it safe for shared branches.
- Always use revert (not reset) for undoing changes on remote branches.

---

## Task 9 – Force Push (With Caution)

> ⚠️ Use this only in your own branch (never on `main` or `develop`).

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-force
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `new_branch.png`.

2. Make and commit a small change.
   - Save a screenshot as `force_commit.png`.

3. Push it:
   ```bash
   git push origin test-force
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `push_force_branch.png`.

4. Perform a hard reset:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `hard_reset_force.png`.

5. Push again
   ```bash
   git push origin test-force
   ```
   - Rejected by remote repository
   - Save a screenshot as `normal_push.png`.

6. Now force-push to remote:
   ```bash
   git push origin test-force --force
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `force_push.png`.

📸 **Screenshot Required:**  
- `new_branch.png`
- `force_commit.png`
- `push_force_branch.png`
- `hard_reset_force.png`
- `normal_push.png`
- `force_push.png`

---

**Summary:**  
- Force push (`git push --force`) rewrites remote branch history, overwriting changes.
- Only use on non-shared branches to avoid disrupting collaborators.
- Always double-check before force-pushing.

## Exam Evaluation Questions


### 1. Local vs Remote Conflict Resolution

**Steps:**
1. On GitHub, edit a file (e.g., `README.md`) and commit the change.  
   - Screenshot as `Q1_remote_edit.png`
2. On your local machine, edit the same file differently (Avoid Conflict) and commit.  
   - Screenshot as `Q1_local_edit.png`
3. Try to push your local commit and observe the error.  
   - Screenshot as `Q1_push_error.png`
4. Resolve the conflict by running `git pull` (merge), then push.  
   - Screenshot as `Q1_merge_resolution.png`
5. Repeat with another remote/local change, but resolve using `git pull --rebase`, then push.

### 2. Manual Merge Conflict Handling

**Steps:**
1. On GitHub, change a specific line in a file and commit.  
   - Screenshot as `Q2_remote_conflict_edit.png`
2. Locally, change the same line differently and commit.  
   - Screenshot as `Q2_local_conflict_edit.png`
3. Try to push your local change and observe the conflict error.  
   - Screenshot as `Q2_conflict_push_error.png`
4. Use `git pull --rebase` to fetch changes and trigger the conflict.  
   - Screenshot as `Q2_rebase_conflict.png`
5. Edit the conflicted file to resolve the conflict manually.  
   - Screenshot as `Q2_resolved_file.png`
6. Mark the conflict resolved (`git add <file>`, `git rebase --continue`) and push.  
   - Screenshot as `Q2_resolution_complete.png`

### 3. Managing Ignored and Tracked Files

**Steps:**
1. Create a new folder (e.g., `DocFiles`) and add several files inside.  
   - Screenshot as `Q3_folder_created.png`
2. Commit and push the folder/files to GitHub.  
   - Screenshot as `Q3_files_pushed.png`
3. Add the folder to your `.gitignore` file.  
   - Screenshot as `Q3_gitignore_added.png`
4. Commit and push the `.gitignore` update.  
   - Screenshot as `Q3_gitignore_pushed.png`
5. Remove the folder from tracking using `git rm -r --cached <folder>`.  
   - Screenshot as `Q3_folder_untracked.png`
6. Commit and push the change, then verify the folder is no longer tracked on GitHub.  
   - Screenshot as `Q3_folder_removed_github.png`

### 4. Commit History Manipulation and Recovery

**Steps:**
1. Make a change and commit it.  
   - Screenshot as `Q4_first_commit.png`
2. Make another change and commit again.  
   - Screenshot as `Q4_second_commit.png`
3. View your commit history.  
   - Screenshot as `Q4_commit_history.png`
4. Perform a soft reset (`git reset --soft HEAD~1`) and observe your file and history.  
   - Screenshot as `Q4_soft_reset.png`
5. Make commit again.
   - Screenshot as `Q4_third_commit.png`
6. Perform a hard reset (`git reset --hard HEAD~1`) and observe the changes.  
   - Screenshot as `Q4_hard_reset.png`

## Summary

In this lab, you practiced a broad range of advanced Git commands and real-world development workflows used in cloud computing, DevOps, and modern software engineering:

- **Conflict Resolution:**  
  - Handled situations where both local and remote repositories have new commits using `git pull --no-rebase` and `git pull --rebase`.
  - Learned the differences between merge and rebase strategies for integrating changes.

- **Manual Merge Conflict Handling:**  
  - Created and resolved manual merge conflicts, using conflict markers and manual file edits to safely integrate changes from different sources.

- **Managing Ignored and Tracked Files:**  
  - Used `.gitignore` to prevent new files from being tracked.
  - Untracked already committed files with `git rm --cached`, keeping them locally but removing them from the remote repository.

- **Temporary Change Management:**  
  - Used `git stash` to save work-in-progress changes, switch branches, and later restore your work—an essential tool for managing feature development and avoiding accidental data loss.

- **Commit History Manipulation and Recovery:**  
  - Inspected commit history with `git log`.
  - Used soft and hard resets (`git reset --soft`, `git reset --hard`) to roll back commits, understanding the differences and implications for your files and history.

- **Amending and Reverting Commits:**  
  - Modified the most recent commit with `git commit --amend`.
  - Safely reverted committed changes on the remote branch with `git revert`, without rewriting history.

- **Force Push (With Caution):**  
  - Practiced rewriting remote branch history with `git push --force`, understanding when (and when not) to use this powerful but risky command.

- **Working with GitHub Codespaces and Docker Compose:**  
  - Forked and ran a full web application (Gitea) inside GitHub Codespaces using Docker Compose.
  - Installed and configured a self-hosted Git service, created repositories in Gitea, and documented the workflow with screenshots.

- **Publishing a Static Website with GitHub Pages:**  
  - Created a personalized GitHub Pages repository using your username.
  - Published a portfolio or CV as a static website and confirmed its live status using GitHub’s Pages feature.

You now have hands-on experience with advanced Git commands, conflict resolution, repository management, cloud-based development environments, and static site hosting—all essential skills for modern DevOps and collaborative software development.
